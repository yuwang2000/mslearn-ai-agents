Develop an AI agent
In this exercise, you'll use Azure AI Agent Service to create a simple agent that analyzes data and creates charts. The agent can use the built-in Code Interpreter tool to dynamically generate any code required to analyze data.

Tip: The code used in this exercise is based on the for Microsoft Foundry SDK for Python. You can develop similar solutions using the SDKs for Microsoft .NET, JavaScript, and Java. Refer to Microsoft Foundry SDK client libraries for details.

This exercise should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

Note: Some of the technologies used in this exercise are in preview or in active development. You may experience some unexpected behavior, warnings, or errors.

Create a Foundry project
Let's start by creating a Foundry project.

In a web browser, open the Foundry portal at https://ai.azure.com and sign in using the username User1-61903522@LODSPRODMCA.onmicrosoft.com and the TAP Ru6AKMrd. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the Foundry logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the Help pane if it's open):

Screenshot of Foundry portal.

Important: For this lab, you're using the New Foundry experience.

In the top banner, select Start building to try the new Microsoft Foundry Experience.

When prompted, create a new project, and enter Project61903522.

Expand Advanced options and specify the following settings:

Foundry resource: project61903522-resource
Subscription: Your Azure subscription
Resource group: Select your resource group, or create a new one
Region: Select any AI Foundry recommended
* Some Azure AI resources are constrained by regional model quotas. In the event of a quota limit being exceeded later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.

Select Create and wait for your project to be created.

After your project is created, select Build from the navigation bar.

Select Models from the left-hand menu, and then select Deploy a base model.

Enter gpt-4.1 in the search box, and then select the gpt-4.1 model from the search results.

Select Deploy with the default settings to create a deployment of the model.

After the model is deployed, the playground for the model is displayed.

In the navigation bar on the left, select Microsoft Foundry to return to the Foundry home page.

Copy the Project endpoint value to a notepad, as you'll use them to connect to your project in a client application.

Create an agent client app
Now you're ready to create a client app that uses an agent. Some code has been provided for you in a GitHub repository.

Clone the repo containing the application code
Open a new browser tab (keeping the Foundry portal open in the existing tab). Then in the new tab, browse to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com; signing in with the username User1-61903522@LODSPRODMCA.onmicrosoft.com and the TAP Ru6AKMrd if prompted.

Close any welcome notifications to see the Azure portal home page.

Use the [>_] button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a PowerShell environment with no storage in your subscription.

The cloud shell provides a command-line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal. You can resize or maximize this pane to make it easier to work in.

Note: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a Bash environment, switch it to PowerShell.

In the cloud shell toolbar, in the Settings menu, select Go to Classic version (this is required to use the code editor).

Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell before continuing.

In the cloud shell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise (type the command, or copy it to the clipboard and then right-click in the command line and paste as plain text):

TypeCopy
rm -r ai-agents -f
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents ai-agents
Tip: As you enter commands into the cloudshell, the output may take up a large amount of the screen buffer and the cursor on the current line may be obscured. You can clear the screen by entering the cls command to make it easier to focus on each task.

Enter the following command to change the working directory to the folder containing the code files and list them all.

TypeCopy
cd ai-agents/Labfiles/02-build-ai-agent/Python
ls -a -l
The provided files include application code, configuration settings, and data.

Configure the application settings
In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you'll use:

TypeCopy
python -m venv labenv
./labenv/bin/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install openai
Enter the following command to edit the configuration file that has been provided:

TypeCopy
code .env
The file is opened in a code editor.

In the code file, replace the your_project_endpoint placeholder with the endpoint for your project (copied from the project overview page in the Foundry portal) and ensure that the MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME variable is set to your model deployment name (which should be gpt-4.1).

After you've replaced the placeholder, use the CTRL+S command to save your changes and then use the CTRL+Q command to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

Write code for an agent app
Tip: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation. Use the comment indentation levels as a guide.

Enter the following command to edit the code file that has been provided:

TypeCopy
code agent.py
Review the existing code, which retrieves the application configuration settings and loads data from data.txt to be analyzed. The rest of the file includes comments where you'll add the necessary code to implement your data analysis agent.

Find the comment Add references and add the following code to import the classes you'll need to build an Azure AI agent that uses the built-in code interpreter tool:

python
TypeCopy
# Add references
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.ai.projects.models import PromptAgentDefinition, CodeInterpreterTool, CodeInterpreterToolAuto
Find the comment Connect to the AI Project and OpenAI clients and add the following code to connect to the Azure AI project.

Tip: Be careful to maintain the correct indentation level.

python
TypeCopy
# Connect to the AI Project and OpenAI clients
with (
   DefaultAzureCredential(
       exclude_environment_credential=True,
       exclude_managed_identity_credential=True) as credential,
    AIProjectClient(endpoint=project_endpoint, credential=credential) as project_client,
    project_client.get_openai_client() as openai_client
):
The code connects to the Foundry project using the current Azure credentials. The final with agent_client statement starts a code block that defines the scope of the client, ensuring it's cleaned up when the code within the block is finished.

Find the comment Upload the data file and create a CodeInterpreterTool, within the with agent_client block, and add the following code to upload the data file to the project and create a CodeInterpreterTool that can access the data in it:

python
TypeCopy
# Upload the data file and create a CodeInterpreterTool
file = openai_client.files.create(
   file=open(file_path, "rb"), purpose="assistants"
)
print(f"Uploaded {file.filename}")

code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool(
   container=CodeInterpreterToolAuto(file_ids=[file.id])
)
Find the comment Define an agent that uses the CodeInterpreterTool and add the following code to define an AI agent that analyzes data and can use the code interpreter tool you defined previously:

python
TypeCopy
# Define an agent that uses the CodeInterpreterTool
agent = project_client.agents.create_version(
   agent_name="data-agent",
   definition=PromptAgentDefinition(
       model=model_deployment,
       instructions="You are an AI agent that analyzes the data in the file that has been uploaded. Use Python to calculate statistical metrics as necessary.",
       tools=[code_interpreter],
   ),
)
print(f"Using agent: {agent.name}")
Find the comment Create a conversation for the chat session and add the following code to start a thread on which the chat session with the agent will run:

python
TypeCopy
# Create a conversation for the chat session
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()
Note that the next section of code sets up a loop for a user to enter a prompt, ending when the user enters "quit".

Find the comment Send a prompt to the agent and add the following code to add a user message to the prompt (along with the data from the file that was loaded previously), and then run thread with the agent.

python
TypeCopy
# Send a prompt to the agent
openai_client.conversations.items.create(
   conversation_id=conversation.id,
   items=[{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": user_prompt}],
)

response = openai_client.responses.create(
   conversation=conversation.id,
   extra_body={"agent": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
   input="",
)
Find the comment Check the response status for failures and add the following code to check for any errors.

python
TypeCopy
# Check the response status for failures
if response.status == "failed":
   print(f"Response failed: {response.error}")
Find the comment Show the latest response from the agent and add the following code to retrieve the messages from the completed thread and display the last one that was sent by the agent.

python
TypeCopy
# Show the latest response from the agent
print(f"Agent: {response.output_text}")
Find the comment Get the conversation history, which is after the loop ends, and add the following code to print out the messages from the conversation thread; reversing the order to show them in chronological sequence

python
TypeCopy
# Get the conversation history
print("\nConversation Log:\n")
items = openai_client.conversations.items.list(conversation_id=conversation.id)
for item in items:
    if item.type == "message":
        print(f"item.content[0].type = {item.content[0].type}")
        role = item.role.upper()
        content = item.content[0].text
        print(f"{role}: {content}\n")
Find the comment Clean up and add the following code to delete the agent and thread when no longer needed.

python
TypeCopy
# Clean up
openai_client.conversations.delete(conversation_id=conversation.id)
print("Conversation deleted")

project_client.agents.delete_version(agent_name=agent.name, agent_version=agent.version)
print("Agent deleted")
Review the code, using the comments to understand how it:

Connects to the AI Foundry project.
Uploads the data file and creates a code interpreter tool that can access it.
Creates a new agent that uses the code interpreter tool and has explicit instructions to use Python as necessary for statistical analysis.
Runs a thread with a prompt message from the user along with the data to be analyzed.
Checks the status of the run in case there's a failure
Retrieves the messages from the completed thread and displays the last one sent by the agent.
Displays the conversation history
Deletes the agent and thread when they're no longer required.
Save the code file (CTRL+S) when you have finished. You can also close the code editor (CTRL+Q); though you may want to keep it open in case you need to make any edits to the code you added. In either case, keep the cloud shell command-line pane open.

Sign into Azure and run the app
In the cloud shell command-line pane, enter the following command to sign into Azure.

TypeCopy
az login
You must sign into Azure - even though the cloud shell session is already authenticated.

Note: In most scenarios, just using az login will be sufficient. However, if you have subscriptions in multiple tenants, you may need to specify the tenant by using the --tenant parameter. See Sign into Azure interactively using the Azure CLI for details.

When prompted, follow the instructions to open the sign-in page in a new tab and enter the authentication code provided and the username User1-61903522@LODSPRODMCA.onmicrosoft.com and the TAP Ru6AKMrd. Then complete the sign in process in the command line, selecting the subscription containing your Foundry hub if prompted.

After you have signed in, enter the following command to run the application:

TypeCopy
python agent.py
The application runs using the credentials for your authenticated Azure session to connect to your project and create and run the agent.

When prompted, view the data that the app has loaded from the data.txt text file. Then enter a prompt such as:

TypeCopy
What's the category with the highest cost?
Tip: If the app fails because the rate limit is exceeded. Wait a few seconds and try again. If there is insufficient quota available in your subscription, the model may not be able to respond.

View the response. Then enter another prompt, this time requesting a visualization:

TypeCopy
Create a text-based bar chart showing cost by category
View the response. Then enter another prompt, this time requesting a statistical metric:

TypeCopy
What's the standard deviation of cost?
View the response.

You can continue the conversation if you like. The thread is stateful, so it retains the conversation history - meaning that the agent has the full context for each response. Enter quit when you're done.

Review the conversation messages that were retrieved from the thread - which may include messages the agent generated to explain its steps when using the code interpreter tool.

Summary
In this exercise, you used the Azure AI Agent Service SDK to create a client application that uses an AI agent. The agent can use the built-in Code Interpreter tool to run dynamic Python code to perform statistical analyses.

Clean up
If you've finished exploring Azure AI Agent Service, you should delete the resources you have created in this exercise to avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs.

Return to the browser tab containing the Azure portal (or re-open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com in a new browser tab) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the resources used in this exercise.
On the toolbar, select Delete resource group.
Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.
